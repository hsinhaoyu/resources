* Org-roam workflow
- find files, new files: =C-c n e= (or =consult-org-roam-file-find=)
- backlinks: =C-c n b= (or =consult-org-roam-backlinks=)
- search: =C-c n r= (or =consult-org-roam-search=)
- new daily: =org-roam-dailies-capture-today=

* Writing
- =ispell-word= suggests correct spelling

* Movements: s-expressions and strings
| key   | function                                      |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| C-M-f | move forward by s-exp (=forward-sexp=)        |
| C-M-b | move backward by s-exp                        |
| C-M-d | move down into a list                         |
| C-M-u | move down into a list                         |
| C-M-n | move forward to the next list (=forward-list=) |
| C-M-p | move backward to the previous list            |
|       |                                               |


- When the point is inside a s-expression or a string, to go to the beginning of the s-expression, use =C-M-u= (go "up" an expression)
- When the point is inside a s-expression or a string, to go to the end of the s-expression, use =C-M-u= and then =C-M-f= (go "forward")
- To kill a s-expression or string, =C-M-u= and then =C-M-k= (=kill-sexp=).

* Deleting
- Delete the word that the point is in: M-b then M-d (i.e., first move to the beginning of a word, and then delete it)

* Coding: spell check existing code
=M-x ispell-comments-and-strings=

*  Coding: movement
| key   | function                            |
|-------+-------------------------------------|
| C-M-a | move to the beginning of a function |
| C-M-e | move to the end of  a function      |
