### Numerical methods 
- [Array programming with NumPy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2): Published in Nature! A good overview of Numpy.

### Scheme programming
- [Scheme and the art of programming](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~williams/cs357/springer-friedman.pdf): This is an old programming textbook that I didn't finish. I always want to return to the later chapters.
