### Emacs
- An epic book-length [config script](https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d) 
- [This](https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1.html) is a good tutorial about how to use org-mode and org-roam effectively.
- [Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text!](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#Projects)
- How to write [snippets](https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-development.html)

### Hugo - static website generator
